HttpClient is a library to make it easier to interact with web servers from Arduino.

Dependencies:
- Requires the new Ethernet library API (with DHCP and DNS) which is in Arduino 1.0.

Installation:
- Click the "Download Zip" button on the right-hand-side of https://github.com/amcewen/HttpClient and save the file somewhere
- Run the Arduino IDE
- In the IDE, go to the Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library... menu option
- Find the zip file that you saved in the first step, and choose that
- Check that it has been successfully added by opening the Sketch -> Import Library menu.  You should now see HttpClient listed among the available libraries.

In normal usage, handles the outgoing request and Host header.  The returned status code is
parsed for you, as is the Content-Length header (if present).
