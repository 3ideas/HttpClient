HttpClient is a library to make it easier to interact with web servers from Arduino.

Dependencies:
- Requires the new Ethernet library API (with DHCP and DNS) which is in Arduino 1.0.
- Requires the b64 base64 encoding library, available from https://github.com/amcewen/b64

In normal usage, handles the outgoing request and Host header.  The returned status code is
parsed for you, as is the Content-Length header (if present).
